### Style / Tactics
___
Usually reads the opponents future to see if she would lose the fight and if she is destined to she burns the book and makes a run for it.
For people with less complicated Ordersets she just tries to overwhelm them using raw strength. When they are too complicated she will try to abuse the weaknesses in the book but sometimes she just is unable to do anything so she just goes away.
___
### Scaling 
___
A physical Monster that surpasses all members of the T2 when it comes to physicality. The Lack of any function with attack potency makes her a very bad matchup for people with complicated Ordersets.
